### Hey 👋

- 🚀 Andrei Bacin, 18 years old, Brazilian, and one day, a great developer.
- 📚 Studying Web Development at IMED and CMS at IFSul.
- 👾 Currently working with JS, HTML and CSS.
- 👨‍💻 I enjoy to study and learn, always focused on improving what I already know and developing myself, and when I'm lazy, Elon Musk's speeches always help me.
- 🚗 Fun Fact: As I love cars and drift, people often call me the "Drift King".

**"People should pursue what they're passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else."** 
*-Elon Musk*
